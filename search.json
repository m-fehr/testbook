    "text": "General Information\nThe lecture Fire Simulations at the University of Wuppertal is organised by the chair of Computational Civil Engineering (CCE). The 2019 founded chair is mainly concerned with the research and development of new computer-based models. The focus of the application is the numerical simulation of fire and smoke propagation in buildings.\n\nThis is the first year that we offer this script. The motivation to create this script is on the one hand to give the participants of the lecture a possibility to read the contents. And on the other hand, to make this content freely available to external or former participants.\nHowever, this script is very short and will remain so. Much of the content is already available in greater depth, so that reference is made to the relevant passages - instead of simply copying them.\nAs the script is under development, we welcome constructive suggestions and your feedback. This way you can support our whole fire science community.\nFor the University of Wuppertal students: All organisational information on the procedure can be found on the CCE website on the fire simulations lecture.",

In the course of the lecture, we will announce the contents relevant for you accordingly.\nThe script also contains exercises for all topics, with and without solution paths, but always with a result or the possibility of validating your solution.\nDo not print out the script or save it elsewhere. This way you have the latest version, which is continuously improved and supplemented with content.\nThe script will always remain freely accessible.\nThe lecture notes and exercises are designed for FDS version 6.7.5, and thus may not be valid / reproducible for other versions.",
