    "text": "General Information\nThe lecture Fire Simulations at the University of Wuppertal is organised by the chair of Computational Civil Engineering (CCE). The 2019 founded chair is mainly concerned with the research and development of new computer-based models. The focus of the application is the numerical simulation of fire and smoke propagation in buildings.\n\nThis is the first year that we offer this script. The motivation to create this script is on the one hand to give the participants of the lecture a possibility to read the contents. And on the other hand, to make this content freely available to external or former participants.\nHowever, this script is very short and will remain so. Much of the content is already available in greater depth, so that reference is made to the relevant passages - instead of simply copying them.\nAs the script is under development, we welcome constructive suggestions and your feedback. This way you can support our whole fire science community.\nFor the University of Wuppertal students: All organisational information on the procedure can be found on the CCE website on the fire simulations lecture.",

This way you have the latest version, which is continuously improved and supplemented with content.\nThe script will always remain freely accessible.\nThe lecture notes and exercises are designed for FDS version 6.7.5, and thus may not be valid / reproducible for other versions.",

The focus of the application here is fire and smoke propagation in buildings.\nIn teaching, we focus on computer science and numerics. The main lectures we offer are Computer Science and Fire Simulations. In addition to this, we regularly offer workshops on data analysis and Raspberry Pi.\nThe simulation models we develop and use are mostly based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In addition, we use genetic optimisation algorithms and image processing methods. What they all have in common is the use of parallel computers, such as the supercomputer JURECA at the Forschungszentrum Jülich.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: JURECA supercomputer. Source: Forschungszentrum Jülich\n\n\n\nOur research activities include the use and further development of FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator), which can be used to calculate the spread of smoke and fire in buildings. On the other hand, the development of new simulation tools. These include, for example, the simulation software ARTSS (Accelerator-based Real-Time Smoke Simulator) or PROPTI. The research is carried out in close cooperation with the Fire Dynamics department at the Jülich Research Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
