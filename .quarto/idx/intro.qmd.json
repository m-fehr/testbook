The focus of the application here is fire and smoke propagation in buildings. \n\nIn teaching, we focus on computer science and numerics. The main lectures we offer are [Computer Science](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php?id=4178&L=0) and [Fire Simulations](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php?id=4185&L=0). In addition to this, we regularly offer workshops on *data analysis* and *Raspberry Pi*. \n\nThe simulation models we develop and use are mostly based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In addition, we use genetic optimisation algorithms and image processing methods. What they all have in common is the use of parallel computers, such as the supercomputer [JURECA](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/JURECA/JURECA_node.html) at the [Forschungszentrum J端lich](https://fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html).\n\n![JURECA supercomputer. Source: Forschungszentrum J端lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/systems/supercomputers/jureca/jureca-dc.jpeg/@@images/image){#fig-jureca width=\"80%\"}\n\nOur research activities include the use and further development of [FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) (Fire Dynamics Simulator), which can be used to calculate the spread of smoke and fire in buildings. On the other hand, the development of new simulation tools. These include, for example, the simulation software [ARTSS](https://github.com/FireDynamics/ARTSS) (Accelerator-based Real-Time Smoke Simulator) or [PROPTI](https://github.com/FireDynamics/propti). The research is carried out in close cooperation with the [Fire Dynamics](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7/EN/Research/Fire_Dynamics/_node.html) department at the J端lich Research Centre.\n\n<!-- Thats the way videos should be included:\n{{< video https://uni-wuppertal.sciebo.de/s/nVLI1zYV20rBESP/download\n    title=\"Simulation of fires in an underground station, part of the [ORPHEUS project](http://www.orpheus-projekt.de), using the software [FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/).\"\n>}} -->\n<!-- \n|<video controls width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://uni-wuppertal.sciebo.de/s/L8WzAy7adlX45Yk/download\" type=\"video/mp4\"> </video>|\n|:--:|\n|Simulation of fires in an underground station, part of the [ORPHEUS project](http://www.orpheus-projekt.de), using the software [FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/).|\n\n\n| <video controls width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://uni-wuppertal.sciebo.de/s/muvLoJ1qgmJgBHT/download\" type=\"video/mp4\"> </video> |\n|:--:|\n| Simulation of a liquid fire with the software [OpenFoam](https://www.openfoam.com/) |\n\n| <video controls width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://uni-wuppertal.sciebo.de/s/mBzgUtDRcZfYJRb/download\" type=\"video/mp4\"> </video> |\n|:--:|\n| Self-consistent simulation of fire spread along a cable route, part of @Hehnen.2020.
